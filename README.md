Tutorial for first app of angular

Basic online store catalog, with a product list, "Share" button, and "Notify Me" button. Learned about the foundation of Angular: components and template syntax. Learned how the component class and template interact, and how components communicate with each other.

Used five common features of Angular's template syntax:

*ngFor
*ngIf
Interpolation {{ }}
Property binding [ ]
Event binding ( )

Created a shopping cart with:
  Update the product details page to include a "Buy" button, which adds the current product to a list of products managed by a cart service.
  Add a cart component, which displays the items you added to your cart.
  Add a shipping component, which retrieves shipping prices for the items in the cart by using Angular's HttpClient to retrieve shipping data from a .json file.
